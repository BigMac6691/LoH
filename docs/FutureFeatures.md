### Basic chat
- Safe mode
   - safe means no trash talking or personal insults - just play the game guys, vulgarity is allowed
   - text colour will be distinct in safe mode
   - report button will be placed on safe mode
   - if a report is filed a review takes place
   - when a report is filed the offender will no longer be able to chat anywhere in the game until the review is done
   - if abuse of the reporting feature is suspect the report will be suspended
   - if the review finds a violation then the offender is suspended
   - the review is subjective and final, every attempt will be made to be fair but I got better things to do
   - repeat offenders  will be ejected from the game and site
- Regular mode
   - regular mode is a free for all, crude and crass behaviour as much as I personally hate it will be ignored
   - threats, doxing are never allowed
- A user will indicate in their profile which mode they will allow, it is all or nothing
    - default is safe mode
    - all group chats are always safe mode
    - you are very much encouraged to use other platforms to communicate, this is intended to be a very basic chat so you can share links to other platforms :)
